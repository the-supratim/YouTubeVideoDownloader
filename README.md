# YouTubeVideoDownloader
If you don't have YouTube Premium subscription (like I don't) but still want to download YouTube videos to watch when offline, then this software is a very effective way of downloading YouTube videos directly to your system for FREE.

STEPS TO DOWNLOAD YOUTUBE VIDEO:

1. Copy the code to your system's code editor (eg. Visual Studio Code) and save it on your system.
2. Open YouTube and search for the video you want to download, and copy it's link address.
3. In your code editor, in the terminal section, compile and run the program with the link of the YouTube video passed as an argument within double-inverted quotes.
4. Wait for a while for the video to be downloaded on to your system.
5. After the download is complete, a message will be displayed onto your screen.

A demo video of the above steps is attached for more convenience.

Thank you for trying my software. Hope you liked it.
